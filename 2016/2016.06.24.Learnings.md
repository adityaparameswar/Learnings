## Special characters leading to failure of loading Eclipse Project Files

Special characters in eclipse project file (`.project`) descriptions make eclipse reject it as a valid project file.
So make sure
a. you don't use special characters "&", "#" etc. as part of the project file name!
b. xml encode the special characters

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<projectDescription>
  <comment>Sample hello world application & service</comment>
...
```
leads to

and the fix is
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<projectDescription>
  <comment>Sample hello world application &amp; service</comment>
...
```
